# Real-World Battlefield Simulator

## Overview
Battlefield Simulator (remark: has no relation to Battlefield games) is my project in which I will use all my knowledge gained in CS, Math, Physics and ML to create a simulation that represents real-world modern warfare.

As an Israeli, I'll use Israel/US-made weaponry as well as some of Arabic countries. Information that is not publicly accessible will be replaced with estimated values.

The simulation aims to:
- Model realistic physics of projectiles, explosions, and ballistics
- Simulate various terrain and weather conditions
- Create AI-driven tactical decision making
- Provide visualization of battlefield scenarios

## Project Status
ðŸš§ **Under Development** ðŸš§

## Technical Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **ML Framework**: Custom-built (no external AI API providers)
- **Physics Engine**: [TBD]
- **Visualization**: [TBD]
- **Testing**: [TBD]

## Architecture
The project follows Domain-Driven Design principles with the following components:
- Core simulation engine
- Physics calculation modules
- ML-based decision making
- Data visualization layer
- Scenario configuration system

## Installation & Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/battlefield-simulator.git
cd battlefield-simulator

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the simulation
python src/main.py
```
