# Real-World Battlefield Simulator

## Overview
Battlefield Simulator (remark: has no relation to Battlefield games) is my project in which I will use all my knowledge gained in CS, Math, Physics and ML to create a simulation that represents real-world modern warfare.

As an Israeli, I'll use Israel/US-made weaponry as well as some of Arabic countries. Information that is not publicly accessible will be replaced with estimated values.

The simulation aims to:
- Model realistic physics of projectiles, explosions, and ballistics
- Simulate various terrain and weather conditions
- Create AI-driven tactical decision making
- Provide visualization of battlefield scenarios

## Technical Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **ML Framework**: Custom-built (no external AI API providers)
- **Physics Engine**: [TBD]
- **Visualization**: [TBD]
- **Testing**: [TBD]

## Installation & Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the simulation
python3 src/main.py
```
